Sophie T’s is a small family-run teashop. Lynne Terrell (alias Mrs T) and her fantastic team, Emma, Rebecca, Lesley, Claire, Emily and Lauren will give you a warm welcome Tuesday to Saturday 9.00am – 4.30pm.

Mrs T and Emma bake cakes and scones every morning from Mrs T’s mums recipes ( no packet mixes here!) and all food orders are freshly made at the time of ordering.

Sophie T’s is named after our daughter Sophie who died aged 6 from Neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer.
